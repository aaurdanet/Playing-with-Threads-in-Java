Threaded User Count Example

This Java program demonstrates the use of multi-threading to concurrently increment a shared user count variable. Two threads, along with the main thread, increment the userCount in a synchronized manner. The program provides insights into the behavior of concurrently executing threads.

Usage

    Compile the Java program:

    bash

javac ThreadExample.java

Run the program:

bash

    java ThreadExample

Code Structure
ThreadExample Class

The ThreadExample class extends the Thread class and overrides the run method. This method simulates the behavior of threads incrementing the userCount in a loop. The increment operation is synchronized to ensure thread safety. The shutdown boolean flag allows threads to exit the loop prematurely.
Main Method

The main method creates an instance of ThreadExample and starts it (example.start()). Another instance is created and started directly ((new ThreadExample()).start()). The main thread also increments the userCount in a loop, using synchronization to avoid race conditions. The final user count for the main thread is printed.
